Knock Knock IIT Patna

Standing at Gate-1 I was painting pictures of my future in IIT Patna and figuring out how will I live without my family.
Just then when my eyes were filled with tears I felt a hand on my back. Before I turned around she put her arms around
me and said "Main hun na". This was my senior. IIT Patna is not defined by the campus or its infrastructure but by the
people who are here. Moving on to my roommates, they are the best (maybe not exactly ;). My batchmates and talents are 
inseperable. Then clubs here are quite cool. Infinito was remarkable and the pronight was enjoyment to it's peak.
And the git session was good as well:)
